<h3>Opening a Port on Google Cloud</h3>

<p>By default, Google Cloud puts your virtual machine behind a
firewall, so it is not accessible from the internet. This is because
anything that is accessible on the internet is constantly being probed
by hackers. To make your Python web application accessible to anyone,
as you need to do for this project, you will need to follow the steps
below. Please make sure you don't put any valuable data on the virtual
machine.</p>

<p>Google Cloud has the concept of "Networks," with network firewall
rules. When a virtual machine is created, it is placed in a
project. All the virtual machines in that project have the same
firewall rules applied. To make a port accessible, you need to edit
the networks settings for the VM instances, as follows.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to your Google Cloud portal page for your virtual machine</li>
  
  <li>Once the Compute Engine is set up and ready click on the "VM
    instances" link
    <img alt="" src="./gcport_files/1.png" height="406" width="662">
  </li>
  
  <li>Click on the "Network" link (see below); next, click on the
  Firewall rules tab and add the required firewall rules using the
  "Create firewall rule" button: write a name such as "allow-flask"; add
  a rule for source IP range as 0.0.0.0/0, for allowed protocols as
  tcp:8111, and for targets to "All Instances On Network"

    <img alt="" src="./gcport_files/3.png" height="406" width="662">
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can now connect to your virtual machine at <code>http://(YOURIP):8111/</code></p>
