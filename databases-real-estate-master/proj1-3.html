  <h4><a>COMS W4111.001-Introduction to Databases</a><br>
  Spring 2020</h4>
  <h2>Project Part 3</h2>
  <h4>(worth 40% of overall Project grade)</h4>
</div>

<h3>Your team</h3>

<p>You will do Part 3 with the same team as for Part
1. If your team partner dropped the class and you did not submit a
contingency plan for this with your Part 1 submission, then
unfortunately you will still have to complete the whole project by
yourself. If you team partner dropped the class and you did submit a
contingency plan for this with your Part 1 submission, then you are
welcome to switch to this reduced version of your project.</p>


<h3>Overview of Part 3</h3>

<p>As you recall from <a href="proj1-1.html">Part 1</a>, you had
two options for Part 3 of the project: you could either follow the Web
Front-End Option or the Expanded-Design Option. You will follow for
Part 3 the option that you stated in Part 1.</p>

<h4>Important notes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>You should make sure that you loaded sufficient data into your
    database to show off all functionality of your application.</li>

  <li>You can make (hopefully small) changes to the SQL schema that
    you created in Part 2. If for some strange reason you feel the
    need to make any radical changes, please check with your project
    mentor ahead of time to avoid any last-minute surprises.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Web Front-End Option</h3>

<p>If you are following the Web Front-End option, you will finish
building the application that you proposed in Part 1, on top of the
database that you created in Part 2. For the final evaluation of
Project Part 3, you will need to submit your code for your application and
a README file on CourseWorks by <strong>Monday April 13 at 5
p.m.</strong> (see below for further instructions). Also, both team
members will meet with your project mentor between April 14th and 17th. Your project mentor will contact you shortly to
<strong>schedule a 15-minute meeting</strong> for one of those
days. Your implementation will be on Python 3 using Flask, and should
satisfy these requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your application must execute SQL query strings on your database
    on our class's PostgreSQL server.  You cannot use an
    Object-Relational Mapper, or ORM. An important goal of this
    project is that you practice writing and debugging SQL queries as
    part of your application, so tools that attempt to make this "too
    easy" are not permitted.</li>

  <li>Your application must provide a way to view or interact with all
  the entities and relationships in your final E/R diagram.</li>
  
  <li>Your application's web interface does not need to be beautiful
  or sophisticated. Plain text pages are acceptable. You will not get
  additional credit for fancy interfaces, as this is not the focus of
  our course.</li>

  <li>In general, you can use any third-party libraries you want
  except for ORMs or other libraries that simplify database access,
  which are not allowed. If you are unsure if a library is permitted,
  ask your project mentor.</li>

</ul>

<p>The following resources may be helpful for learning both Python and
Flask:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="java2python.html">Java-to-Python Primer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/">Python
tutorial</a></li>
<li><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/">Flask tutorial</a></li>
<li><a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/">Jinja template documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://realpython.com/primer-on-jinja-templating/">Jinja tutorial</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Getting started</h4>

<p>Your job is to implement your proposed web application. To help you
out, we have provided a bare-bones Flask web
application, <code>server.py</code>, <a href="webserver.tar">available
here</a>. It provides code that connects to a database URL, and a
default index page. Take a look at the comments
  in <code>server.py</code> to see how to use or modify the server.
  In particular, note that you will need to modify the value of
  <code>DATABASEURI</code> inside <code>server.py</code>, to refer
  to your PostgreSQL username and password.
  You
will need to connect to your database from Part 2. Please read all
these directions. Once you get it running, you should start working on
  your custom logic.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Please run <code>python --version</code> to
  figure out what version of Python is the default in your VM/virtual
  environment. If the version is 2.7.*, you will need to run Python
  as <code>python3</code> to make sure you are using Python 3.</p>
  

<h4>A short introduction to SQLAlchemy</h4>

<p>We use a Python package called <code>SQLAlchemy</code> to simplify
our work for connecting to the database. For
example, <code>server.py</code> contains the following code to load
useful functions from the package:</p>
<pre>from sqlalchemy import *</pre>

<p><code>SQLAlchemy</code> is able to connect to many different types
of DBMSs, including SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle. Each such
DBMS is called an "engine." The <code>create_engine()</code> function
sets up the configuration to the specific DBMS we want to connect
to:</p>

<pre>engine = create_engine(DATABASEURI)</pre>

<p>Given an engine, we can then connect to it (this is similar to
how <code>psql</code> connects to our class's PostgreSQL database
server):</p>

<pre>conn = engine.connect()</pre>

<p>At this point, the <code>conn</code> connection object can be used
to execute queries to the database. This is basically
what <code>psql</code> is doing under the covers:</p>

<pre>cursor = conn.execute("select 1")</pre>

<p>The <code>execute</code> function takes a SQL query string as input
and returns a <code>cursor</code> object. You can think of this as an
iterator over the result relation. This means you can run <code>SELECT
*</code> on, say, a million-row table and not run out of
memory. Instead of receiving the entire result at once, this object
lets you treat the result as an iterator and call <code>next()</code>
on it, or loop through it. See the
  <a href="http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/connections.html#sqlalchemy.engine.ResultProxy">SQLAlchemy
  documentation</a> for a detailed description.</p>

<pre># this fetches the first row if called right after
# the execute function above. It also moves the
# iterator to the next result row.
record = cursor.fetchone()
# this will fetch the next record, or None if
# there are no more results.
second_record = cursor.fetchone()
# this loops through the results of the cursor one by one
for row in cursor:
  print (list(row))
</pre>

<p>The above description is a way to directly write and run SQL
queries as strings, and directly manipulate the result
relations. SQLAlchemy also includes
an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">Object
Relational Mapper</a> that provides an interface that hides SQL query
strings and result sets from you. <strong>In this project, you will
directly write and run SQL queries, and cannot use any ORM
functionality.</strong></p>

<h4> (Optional) Using a toolkit for application front-end</h4>

You are welcome to use
the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework to
style the front-end of your application. Note that this is by no means
necessary, and styling your application <strong>will not impact
grading in any way</strong>; see "Grading for Web Front-End Option"
below. You are also welcome to use AJAX to create more complex
interactions with your site. However, if you do so, you must use
JQuery and you must add a section to your README file describing where
each call occurs, what triggers the call, what endpoint it hits, and
the call's purpose. Furthermore, any JavaScript you write must be well
commented, and cannot rely on frameworks or libraries not mentioned
here. Particularly, you cannot use any tools that alter the way you
interact with the database (e.g., GraphQL). If you have any questions
regarding specific frameworks, please contact your project mentor.

<h4>Working with a version control system</h4>

<p>Since you are working collaboratively with your teammate,
we <strong>strongly encourage</strong> you to use a version control
system for your code such as <code>git</code>
on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. You should use
a <strong>private repository</strong> on GitHub for this project.

<p>We cover below the basics of <code>git</code>
and <code>GitHub</code>. With this setup, you can code on your own
desktop, commit and push your changes to the <code>GitHub</code>
repository, and then pull the updated changes on your Google Cloud
Compute Engine. You can also code without your teammate being in the
same room, and your teammate will be aware of the changes after
"pulling" the code from <code>GitHub</code>. Conversely, your
teammate will also be able to contribute to the same code repository,
so you can both work collaboratively. Please follow these steps to get
started with <code>git</code> and <code>GitHub</code>:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home">Register an
  account</a> on <code>GitHub</code>. You will need to
  provide/verify your email address and provide a username. There is
  no requirement on what email or username you use here. Your teammate
  should also register for a different account, so that you both have
  access to the code repository.</li>

  <li>Once your account is created, log into <code>GitHub</code>.
    Create a repository by clicking
    on <a href="https://github.com/new">Create a new
    repository</a>.</li>
  
  <li>Give your repository a name, such as "w4111-proj1". From
  here on we will use &lt;projectname&gt; to denote the name that you
  chose in this step for your project. Make sure that you make this
  repository
    <strong>Private</strong> by choosing the correct radio button; also
    do <strong>not</strong> check the README box.</li>
  
  <li>Give your teammate access to the repository, as follows: if your
  repository is at URL <code>&lt;REPOURL&gt;</code>, go to
  webpage <code>&lt;REPOURL&gt;/settings/collaboration</code> by
  manually adding "/settings/collaboration" to the URL (e.g., if your
  repository is at <code>https://github.com/cl3403cl/db4111</code>,
  then go
  to <code>https://github.com/cl3403cl/db4111/settings/collaboration</code>). Enter
  your teammate's <code>GitHub</code> username or email, and click
  "Add collaborator." Your teammate will receive an invitation by
  email, which your teammate should accept. After this, we are done
  with the <code>GitHub</code> web interface.</li>

  <li>Now start your Google Cloud Compute Engine
  (recall <a href="gc-setup.html">our instructions for Part 2</a>),
  <code>ssh</code> into it, and run the following commands:
<pre>
# download and extract our skeleton Flask web application
cd ~
wget http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kar/cs4111/spring20/webserver.tar
# webserver.tar can also be downloaded from Courseworks
tar xf webserver.tar
mv webserver &lt;projectname&gt;
cd &lt;projectname&gt;
chmod -R 777 .
# configure your git environment
git config --global user.name "&lt;your full name&gt;"
git config --global user.email "&lt;email you used to register for GitHub&gt;"
# initialize git repository, and push the skeleton files up to the server
# here &lt;username&gt; denotes your GitHub username
git init
git remote add origin &lt;REPOURL&gt;.git
git add *
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push -u origin master # you will be prompted for your username and password here
</pre>
You have now created a local <code>git</code> repository, made your
first commit, and pushed the files contained in webserver.tar onto
<code>GitHub</code>. Your usual workflow after these initial steps
will be a bit different than this, as described in the next step.</li>

  <li>Your workflow with <code>git</code> will typically comprise the
  following steps:
    <ol type="a"><li>Pull your changes from the <code>GitHub</code>
    repository so that your code is up-to-date: <code>git
    pull</code>. Note that this step is necessary because, when
    working on a project with a teammate, your teammate may have
    updated and pushed the code while you were not working on the
    project, so you should always pull the changes before beginning to
    work on a new revision.</li>
      
      <li>Work on the project, make some changes locally, and test them.</li>
      
      <li>See what <code>git</code> thinks you have changed: <code>git
      status</code></li>
      
      <li>Add any modified files to the next "commit." For example, if
      you modified files <code>server.py</code>
      and <code>README</code>, then run: <code>git add server.py
      README</code></li>
      
      <li>Commit your changes (locally) with an appropriate commit
	message: <code>git commit -m "added feature X"</code></li>

      <li>Push your changes to the <code>GitHub</code>
      server: <code>git push</code></li>
  </ol></li>

  <li>Step 5 is more or less all you need to get started if you are
  working on this project alone. However, if you are working as a
  two-person team, you might even be using different computers to do
  your coding. (It's cumbersome to develop your code directly on
  Google Cloud, and it's much more convenient to use your desktop or
  laptop for writing the code and then "pull" the code into your
  Google Cloud account using <code>git</code>, as discussed in the
  "Running your application..." section below.) So if you carried out
  Step 5 above for your team, then your teammate will need to perform
  the following steps to get a copy of the code on their desktop or
  laptop. Similarly, you will have to perform the steps below for any
  new computer that you want to use to continue developing your code:
<pre>
# configure your git environment, as in Step 5
git config --global user.name "&lt;your full name&gt;"
git config --global user.email "&lt;email you used to register for GitHub&gt;"
# clone (i.e., download) the repository onto your local machine
# use the username of the owner of the repository here
git clone &lt;REPOURL&gt;.git
# you're done setting up; you can now continue as in Step 6</pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><code>git</code> provides many other powerful functions that we
haven't talked about. For more information, you can refer
to <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial">this tutorial</a>,
and documentation on that website. If you encounter a problem with
<code>git</code>, you can typically do a quick search with the error
message and get <strong>a lot</strong> of helpful information
online. Feel free also to come to office hours with any of your
questions about <code>git</code> and <code>GitHub</code>.</p>

<h4>Running your application on your Google Cloud compute engine</h4>

<p>Once you have developed (a preliminary version of) your web
application, you will deploy it to your Google Cloud Compute
Engine, as follows</p>
<ol>
  <li>(One time setup) Follow <a href="gcport.html">our directions</a>
to make a port accessible to the internet so anyone can access your
    application.</li>
  <li>Write down the IP of your virtual machine.</li>
  <li><code>ssh</code> to your virtual machine
  and <a href="gc-setup.html">enter the virtual environment
  you created in Part 2 of the project</a>.</li>
  <li>Make sure you have committed and pushed all the latest changes
    to your code to your <code>GitHub</code> repository. (See Step
    6 above.)</li>
  <li>Copy the latest version of your code to the Google Cloud Compute
    Engine by running <code>git pull</code> on your virtual
    machine.</li>
  <li>Run the Python server with the defaults parameters, which will
  listen for requests on port 8111. Run with <code>--help</code> if
  you need help:
<pre># &lt;projectname&gt; is the name of your repository and directory that you created in Step 5 above
cd &lt;projectname&gt;
python3 server.py</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Go to <code>http://&lt;IP ADDRESS&gt;:8111/</code> in your browser to check that it worked.</li>
</ol>

<p>You will need this URL when presenting the project to your
mentor. Please do not turn off your virtual machine after you are done
modifying your code and when you are ready to submit, so that your IP
address does not change and the URL that you include with your project
  submission works.</p>

<p><strong>Keeping your application running for your meeting with your
mentor:</strong> To keep your application running "in the background"
(so that it is available when you meet with your mentor), you can use
the <code>screen</code> command. To install <code>screen</code>, run on your VM:
<code>sudo apt-get install screen</code>. Run <code>screen</code> in
the terminal, then switch to the correct environment
(recall <a href="gc-setup.html">our instructions for doing so</a>), and
finally execute your server application normally (i.e., by running
<code>python3 server.py</code>). After your application finishes
starting up, press CTRL + a, and then d. The application will be
running in the background now and it is safe for you to log out of the
<code>ssh</code> session. Run <code>screen -r</code> to bring back the
detached screen (and your process) to the foreground, and to stop your
application (after we are done grading Part 3). (For more information
and details on <code>screen</code>, please refer
to <a href="https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/a-quick-tutorial-on-screen/">https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/a-quick-tutorial-on-screen/</a>.)</p>

<h4>What to submit and when for Web Front-End Option</h4>

<p>If you are following the Web Front-End Option, you will need to
submit your code for your application and a README file on CourseWorks
by April 13 at 5 p.m. Here are the instructions for your
electronic submission:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a directory named &lt;groupn&gt;-proj1-3, where you
  should replace &lt;groupn&gt; with your Project 1 Group as specified
  on CourseWorks (for example, if your group is "Project 1 Group 9,"
  then the directory should be named group9-proj1-3).</li>
  
  <li>Copy all the Python source code files into the
  &lt;groupn&gt;-proj1-3 directory, and include all the other files
  that are necessary for your program to run.</li>
  
  <li>Tar and gzip the &lt;groupn&gt;-proj1-3 directory, to generate a
  single file &lt;groupn&gt;-proj1-3.tar.gz, which is the first file
    that you will submit.</li>

  <li>Login to CourseWorks and select the site for our class. To
submit this file, you need to be in the Class view (not the Group
view) and then upload your file to the "Part 3" assignment under
Assignments. Submit file &lt;groupn&gt;-proj1-3.tar.gz.</li>
<li>Separately, submit an uncompressed README file with the following information:
<ul>
  <li>The PostgreSQL account where your database on our server
  resides. (This should be the same database that you used for Part 2,
    but we need you to confirm that we should check that database.)</li>

  <li>The URL of your web application. Once again, please do not turn
  off your virtual machine after you are done modifying your code and
  when you are ready to submit, so that your IP address does not
  change and the URL that you include with your project submission
  works.</li>
  
  <li>A description of the parts of your original proposal in Part 1
  that you implemented, the parts you did not (which hopefully is
  nothing or something very small), and possibly new features that
  were not included in the proposal and that you implemented
  anyway. If you did not implement some part of the proposal in Part
    1, explain why.</li>

  <li>Briefly describe two of the web pages that require (what you
  consider) the most interesting database operations in terms of what
  the pages are used for, how the page is related to the database
  operations (e.g., inputs on the page are used in such and such way
  to produce database operations that do such and such), and why you
    think they are interesting.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>In summary, you need to submit on CourseWorks exactly two files:
(1) your &lt;groupn&gt;-proj1-3.tar.gz file with your code and (2)
your uncompressed README file. You need to submit these two files by
April 13 at 5 p.m.</p>

<p>Additionally, both teammates in each team will meet together with
their project mentor between APril 14 and April 17. Your project
mentor will email you shortly to schedule a 15' meeting for either
day. (If you haven't received an email from your project mentor by
April 1 please contact your mentor immediately after that day.) During
the meeting with your project mentor, you will show your mentor your
application using a regular web browser:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You should have your application up and running so that you and
  your project mentor can access it over the web simply by typing a
  URL in a regular browser. Your project mentor will be running
    Chrome.</li>
  <li>Your project mentor should be able to interact with your
  application and access the functionality that you specified in Part
    1, over the database that you created for Part 2.</li>
  <li>The project mentor might ask to look at your code during your
    meeting.</li>
  <li>Your web interface does not need to be fancy. (See Grading
  below.) However, you should not force users to type SQL. The less
  your web site looks like it is interacting with a relational
  database, the better. At the very least, the user should be
  completely shielded from having to type anything resembling
  SQL. Most interactions should involve some sort of input values in
  addition to the user pressing a "submit" button. Whenever possible,
  input values should be specified using menus, radio buttons,
  checkboxes, scrollers, etc. Text input boxes may also be
  appropriate.</li>
  
  <li>Sophisticated error handling is not necessary; however your web
  site definitely should not "lock up" (i.e., crash or become blocked)
    regardless of how the user chooses to interact with it.</li>

  <li>Your database should contain (at least) the data that you
  entered for Part 2. You can, of course, add extra tuples to your
  tables if you want to make interaction with your application more
  interesting and revealing.</li>

  <li>Your grade will suffer considerably if your application is not
  running properly when you access it from your project mentor's
  machine. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application
    is up and running when you meet with your project mentor.</li>

  <li>You should have a number of example interactions prepared so
  that you can use your meeting time efficiently. The more you can
  impress your project mentor during the 15-minute meeting, the better
    your grade is likely to be, so come to the meeting prepared.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Grading for Web Front-End Option</h4>

<p>Your grade for Part 3 of Project 1 will be a function of how well
your application (which should be up and running) matches your
specification that you submitted as Part 1, of how well you have
incorporated any feedback that your project mentor has given you, and
of how well you have followed the guidelines above. Your grade will
not be influenced by how fancy the web-based user interface to your
application is. It is sufficient and perfectly fine for this interface
to be plain and simple as long as it supports the functionality that
you indicated earlier, following the guidelines above about not having
to type SQL commands, not "locking up" on unexpected input, etc.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Expanded-Design Option</h3>

<p>If you are following the Expanded-Design Option, you need to follow
the expansion plans that you outlined in Part 1, and:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Extend your E/R diagram from Part 1 to include the entity sets
  and relationship sets&mdash;and all associated real-world
    constraints&mdash;for your expanded design.</li>
  <li>Extend your SQL schema from Part 2 of your database on our
  PostgreSQL server to include the mapping of all new entity sets and
  relationship sets, following the directions in Part 2 of the project
    on how to specify constraints in your expanded SQL design.</li>
  <li>Add tuples to your new tables on our PostgreSQL server,
  following the guidelines on the number of tuples from Part 2 of the
  project.</li>
</ol>

<h4>What to submit and when for Expanded-Design Option</h4>

<p>You will submit this part of the project electronically on
CourseWorks directly, along the lines of what you did for Part 2. The
deadline is <strong>Monday April 13 at 5 p.m.</strong> Just as for
Parts 1 and 2, you should submit your project exactly once per team,
rather than once per student. To submit your project, you need to be
in the Class view (not the Group view) on CourseWorks and then upload
your file to the "Part 3" assignment under Assignments. You should
submit one or more (uncompressed) files containing:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The name and UNI of both teammates.</li>
  <li>The PostgreSQL account name for your database on our server
  (i.e., specify which teammate's UNI we should use to identify the
  database for your team.) This will normally be the same database
  that you used for Part 2, but we need you to confirm that we should
  check that database.</li>
  <li>A textual description of your extensions on the database design,
  explaining which entity sets and relationship sets are new, and how
    you mapped them to SQL statements.</li>
  <li>Your new, complete E/R diagram, including all of your entity
  sets and relationship sets, both from Part 1 and the new ones from
    Part 3.</li>
  <li>The CREATE TABLE statements and any other elements of the full
  database that you created on your PostgreSQL database. (We will of
  course also check the schema directly on the database server, but we
  need as well the statements as part of your submission file.) You
  should include all of your tables, not just the new ones for Part
    3.</li>
  <li>Three "interesting" SQL queries over your expanded database,
  with a sentence or two per query explaining what the query is
  supposed to compute. Each of these queries should involve at least
  one of the new tables that you added for Part 3. The goal of these
  queries is to help us better understand your application and your
  additions for Part 3. You will not be graded on these queries, but
  we strongly suggest that you submit well formed queries that run
  without problems, so please make sure that you have tested your
  queries by running them on your database exactly as submitted (use
    copy and paste).</li>
</ol>

<h4>Grading for Expanded Design Option</h4>

<p>Your grade for Part 3 of Project 1 will be a function of how well
you have incorporated any feedback that your project mentor has given
you, and the following factors:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Quality of your expanded E/R diagram: We will evaluate how well
  your expanded E/R diagram implements your plans for the
  Expanded-Design Option from Part 1, and how well your expanded E/R
  diagram models your application, including how well you modeled any
  relevant real-world constraints.</li>
  <li>Quality of your expanded SQL schema and implementation on
  PostgreSQL: We will evaluate how well you mapped your expanded E/R
  diagram, including constraints, into a SQL schema on PostgreSQL,
    using the techniques that we covered in class.</li>
  <li>Quality of your expanded constraint handling: We will evaluate
  how well you managed to capture real-world constraints of your
  expanded design through primary key, foreign key, unique, and
    good-style attribute- and tuple-based CHECK constraints.</li>
  <li>Quality of the expanded real-world (or at least realistic) data
  that you loaded into the expanded database on PostgreSQL.</li>
</ol>
